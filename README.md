## Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

A simple image encryption tool using Python, which employs pixel manipulation techniques. The tool utilizes the Pillow library for image handling and NumPy for array processing. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

Encryption: The tool reads an image, converts it into a NumPy array, and modifies the pixel values by applying a mathematical operation (adding 100).

Decryption: The tool reverses the encryption by subtracting the same value (100) from the modified pixel values, restoring the original image.

This basic encryption method demonstrates fundamental image processing concepts and pixel manipulation, providing a foundation for more complex encryption techniques in the future.
